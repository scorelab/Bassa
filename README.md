Automated Download Queue for Enterprise to take the best use of Internet bandwidth

<hr>

## About
Bassa solves the problem of wasting internet bandwidth by queuing a download if it is larger than a given threshold value in high traffic and when the traffic is low, it completes the download of the files. After the files are downloaded, the users can get their files from the local servers which do not require external internet bandwidth.

## Main functionalities
* Provides an interface for users to add their downloads as links or torrent magnet links
* Provide users with an interface to view and download the files in the local server
* Provide a rating system for users to rate the files residing in local server
* Automatically start and stop downloading in given time frame
* Automatically clean the disks and make room for new downloads
* Notify the users when his/her download is completed
* Mark inappropriate downloads
* Provides admins with an interface to deal with inappropriate files
